# manuelperez.dev

Personal site and blog of Manuel Pérez, live at [manuelperez.dev](https://manuelperez.dev). Spanish at `/`, English at `/en/`.

Built with [Astro](https://astro.build) 7 (fully static, no UI framework) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) 4. Icons come from [Simple Icons](https://simpleicons.org) and [Tabler Icons](https://tabler.io/icons); fonts (Michroma, Exo 2, Share Tech Mono) are self-hosted. The visual style and its rules are in [`docs/STYLEGUIDE.md`](docs/STYLEGUIDE.md).

## Development

Requires Node.js >= 22.23.4.

```shell
npm ci
npm run dev       # http://localhost:4321
npm run build     # outputs to dist/
npm run preview   # serves the build
npm run lint      # Biome + stylelint
npm run format    # applies Biome and stylelint fixes
```

## Project structure

```text
blog/<folder>/      posts: index.md (Spanish), index.en.md (English, optional) and their images
docs/STYLEGUIDE.md  design tokens, typography, components and rules
public/             favicon, share image (og-image.png), robots.txt
src/components/     UI pieces (sidebar, lists, theme and language switchers, icons, SEO)
src/cv/             CV PDF generator
src/data/           profile, experience, stack and post lists, with Spanish and English text
src/i18n.js         interface strings and per-language settings
src/layouts/        BaseLayout (head, theme script), HomePage and PostPage
src/pages/          routes for / and /en/, including /blog/<slug> and /en/blog/<slug>
src/styles/         global CSS and design tokens
```

## Editing content

- **Profile, experience and stack:** `src/data/profile.js`, `src/data/experience.js` and `src/data/stack.js`. Every text is a `{ es, en }` pair. They feed both the site and the CV.
- **About:** `src/components/About.astro`, one block per language.
- **Interface text** (section names, buttons, labels): `src/i18n.js`.

Every text change needs both languages.

## CV

The site publishes a CV in PDF, built from the same data at `/manuel-perez-cv.pdf` and `/en/manuel-perez-cv.pdf`. It is designed for applicant tracking systems: one column, real text, standard headings. The public version has no email or phone.

For applications, generate the full version locally:

```shell
cp cv.private.example.json cv.private.json   # fill in email and phone
npm run cv:private                            # writes cv-private/manuel-perez-cv-{es,en}.pdf
```

Both `cv.private.json` and `cv-private/` are ignored by git.

## Blog posts

Each post is a folder in `blog/` with `index.md` in Spanish and its images next to it. Its frontmatter:

```yaml
title: "CQRS"
date: "2022-02-12"
description: "Short summary for the post list and link previews."
slug: "cqrs"
hero_image: "./main.jpg"
hero_image_alt: "Big building."
hero_image_owner_url: "https://unsplash.com/@author" # optional, credits the photo
```

The URL is `/blog/<slug>`, taken from `slug`, not from the folder name. To add an English version, create `index.en.md` in the same folder with the same `slug`; it is published at `/en/blog/<slug>`. Posts without a translation show up on `/en/` in Spanish with an "In Spanish" badge. Frontmatter is validated in `src/content.config.js`.

## Deploy

Pushing to `main` deploys production on Netlify, which runs `npm run build` and publishes `dist/` (see `netlify.toml`).
